# Will the customer accept the coupon? 

## Context

Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaraunt near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaraunt? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a sunbsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaraunt? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?

Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

## Response
Bar coupons were offered the most on warm days (80F)
Bar coupons were accepted by frequent go-ers (~76% vs ~37%)
Drivers who visit bars greater than 3 times per month are likelier to accept coupons for bars (~76%). 
Drivers visiting bars 1-3 times per month also accepted coupons 
more frequently (64.6%) than the aggregate Bar coupon population.
Based on the above data, I think Amazon should focus on promotions towards drivers visiting a bar once 
per month or more.
