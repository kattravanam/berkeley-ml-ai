# Will the customer accept the coupon? 

Bar coupons were offered the most on warm days (80F)
Bar coupons were accepted by frequent go-ers (~76% vs ~37%)
Drivers who visit bars greater than 3 times per month are likelier to accept coupons for bars (~76%). 
Drivers visiting bars 1-3 times per month also accepted coupons 
more frequently (64.6%) than the aggregate Bar coupon population.
Based on the above data, I think Amazon should focus on promotions towards drivers visiting a bar once 
per month or more.
